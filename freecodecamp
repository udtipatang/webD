if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but also degrade to the Sans-Serif font when Helvetica wasn't available, you could use this CSS style:
p {
  font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif;
}

5-If you want to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:
<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>
You can also specify a border-radius with pixels or percentage(circular images).
