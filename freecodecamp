<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
after this apply the font-family of Lobster.

4-DEGRADATION
if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but also degrade to the Sans-Serif font when Helvetica wasn't available, you could use this CSS style:
p {
  font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif;
}

5-If you want to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:
<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>
You can also specify a border-radius with pixels or percentage(circular images).

8-Text inputs are a convenient way to get input from your user.
  You can create one like this:
  <input type="text">
  
9-Your placeholder text is what appears in your text input before your user has input anything.
  You can create placeholder text like so:
  <input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">
  
10-You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.
  For example:
  <form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>
  
11-Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action attribute.
  Here's an example submit button:
  <button type="submit">this text appears on the button</button>
  
12-You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.
  For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the word required within your input element, you       would use: <input type="text" required>
  
13-You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer.
  Radio buttons are a type of input
  Each of your radio buttons should be nested within its own label element.
  All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute.
  Here's an example of a radio button:
  <form action.......>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor              //     ()indoor ()outdoor
    <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> outdoor
  </label>
  </form>
  
14-Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.
eg.
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>

15-You can set an element's background color with the background-color property.
  .green-background {
  background-color: green;
}
