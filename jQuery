1-Before we can start using jQuery, we need to add some things to our HTML.
  First, add a script element at the top of your page. Be sure to close it on the following line
  Inside your script element, add this code: $(document).ready(function() { to your script. Then close it on the following line (still       inside your script element) with: });
  The important thing to know is that code you put inside this function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.
  
2-All jQuery functions start with a $.
  For example, let's make all button elements bounce. Just add this code inside your document ready function:
  $("button").addClass("animated bounce");            //for all buttons
  $(".text-primary").addClass("animated shake");      //for all elements with class text-primary
  $("#target6").addClass("animated fadeOut").         //for all elements with id as target3
