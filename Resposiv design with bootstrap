1-Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name Responsive Design.
  With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any     width.
  You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
  
2-First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.
  It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.
  Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image.
  
3-Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center   to our h2 element.  
  
4-Create a new button element below your large kitten photo. Give it the class btn and the text of "Like".
  eg.
  <button class="btn">like</button>
  
5-By making button elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal           space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.
  <button class="btn btn-block">Submit</button>
  This button would take up 100% of the available width.

6-The btn-primary class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.

7-Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional actions that the     user can take.
  btn-danger is for red color to the button.

8-Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side
  Put the Like, Info and Delete buttons side-by-side by nesting all three of them within one <div class="row"> element, then each of them   within a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.
  The row class is applied to a div, and the buttons themselves can be nested within it.

  <div class="row">
  
    <div class="col-xs-4">
    <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary col">Like</button>
    </div>
  
    <div class="col-xs-4">
    <button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button>
    </div>
  
    <div class="col-xs-4">
    <button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>
    </div>
 
 </div>

9-Changing color of text
  By using the span element, you can put several elements together, and even style different parts of the same element differently.
  <p>Top 3 things cats <span class = "text-danger">hate:</span></p>  would make "hate:" red in colour
  
10-Putting image by side of your title using bootstrap
   Nest your first image and your h2 element within a single <div class="row"> element. Nest your h2 element within a <div class="col-      xs-8"> and your image in a <div class="col-xs-4"> so that they are on the same line.
    eg._____________________________________________________________________________________
    <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <a href="#"><img class="img-responsive thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat                   lying on its back. "></a>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-8">
              <h2 class="text-primary text-center">CatPhotoApp</h2>
          </div>
    </div>
